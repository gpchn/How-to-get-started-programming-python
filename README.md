## introduction

### Summary
It is an ordinary introductory book of Python programming. 
Not the best, but the most sincere. The author will try hi
s best to give readers what he has learned and what he has 
trodden on. The author is also self-taught, knowing that s
elf-study is not easy. I hope this book can make readers f
eel a little easier in their study.
