# How-to-get-started-programming-python  
## introduction
### Summary
It is an ordinary introductory book of Python programming. Not the best, but the most sincere. The author will try his best to give readers what he has learned and what he has trodden on. The author is also self-taught, knowing that self-study is not easy. I hope this book can make readers feel a little easier in their study.
