## introduction

### Summary
It is an ordinary book of Python programming. Not the best
, but the most sincere. The author will try his best to gi
ve readers what he has learned and what he has trodden on.
The author is also self-taught, knowing that self-study is
not easy. I hope this book can make readers feel a little 
easier in their study.
